# Project Planning
- Refer to trello kanban board for planning overview: https://trello.com/b/xqrSsjwa/telco-classification-project
- Utilized agile program management methodology 
# Initial Ideas
- With recent ransomware attacks on the colonial pipeline to the solarwinds attack still in the news and not going anywhere we are focusing on security
- We have seen customers not focused on security difficult to retain
- Thus we are exploring a nationwide push for a focus on security narrowing down on the security features we already offer as this niche group is less likely to churn, and non security focused customers are more likely to churn
# Hypothesis
- H0: There is no relationship between internet customer churn and the following addtional features:  online_security, online_backup, device_protection, tech_support.

- Ha: There is a relationship between internet customer churn and the following addtional features:  online_security, online_backup, device_protection, tech_support.

    - **True Positive**: Predict there is a relationship and there is a relationship

    - **True Negative**:Predict there is no relationship and there is not relationship

    - **False Positive**: Predict there is a relationship and there is no relationship

    - **False Negative**: Predict there is no relationship and there is a relationship
